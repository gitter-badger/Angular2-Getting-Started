Taken from and based on the following resources...... 

https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-2-getting-started/table-of-contents

To get going, you just need to do this......

Then......

you'll also now have to start the express server for the JSON
